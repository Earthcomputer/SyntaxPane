## JSyntaxPane

This is a clone of the 0.9.6 branch of [JSyntaxPane](http://code.google.com/p/jsyntaxpane/), a Java Swing code editor component (C)opyright by Ayman Al-Sairafi and released under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://github.com/Sciss/JSyntaxPane/blob/master/licenses/JSyntaxPane-License.txt). All changes by Hanns Holger Rutz released under that same license.

Motivation: I prefer github and git over google-code and svn, and want to try to play around with the Scala support.

### requirements

Builds still with maven (sbt is coming). `mvn install` should build the `jar` target.
